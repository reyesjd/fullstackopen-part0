For the correct functioning of the HTML page,
which is sent by the server, the browser needs
main.css and main.js.
So, browser first makes the GET request to 
obtain main.css and then makes the GET request to 
obtain main.js
end note

server->browser: main.css

note over browser:
Browser starts executing the code in main.js,
but it needs data.json that is on the server.
Then a GET request is made to the server to get data.json.
end note
browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
server->browser: data.json

that renders the notes on the page.
